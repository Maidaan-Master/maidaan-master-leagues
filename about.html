    <h1>About Us</h1>

    <h2>Where It All Began</h2>
    <p>Maidaan Master is a passion project of Darshan Shinde, dedicated to Indian Football. After being a fan of European football for 20 years, Darshan wanted to bring the same professionalism to Indian Football. For this, Maidaan Master are baby steps. The main gap that we see is that the public is not given details of leagues that are running, and clubs that are playing. Matches happen haphazardly, and thus building a following is hard, let alone fan following. For this, Maidaan Master was started on August 29, National Sports Day of India, 2023.</p>

    <h2>Growing With Indian Football</h2>
    <p>Maidaan Master initially started covering lower leagues on the national stage. Slowly from there, by 2024, Maidaan Master was covering the entirety of the national scene. By the one-year mark, Maidaan Master was also covering youth matches, banking on the promise and future of Indian football.</p>

    <h2>Personal Steps Into Football</h2>
    <p>In the midst of all this, Darshan also took baby steps to get into mainstream football, by completing the Blue Cubs Coaching badge, making him eligible to coach teams under the age of 11.</p>

    <h2>Zooming Into Maharashtra</h2>
    <p>We also started covering two huge districts in Maharashtra—Mumbai and Thane—with multiple leagues in both the district pyramids.</p>

    <h2>Spreading Across Platforms</h2>
    <p>Maidaan Master is now active across four main platforms: Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and Reddit—sharing results, highlights, and news for fans everywhere.</p>

    <h2>Welcoming Women's Football</h2>
    <p>At the start of 2025, Maidaan Master officially began coverage of Women’s Football in India—another proud step in our journey.</p>

    <h2>Website Launch</h2>
    <p>Today, as of April 2025, Maidaan Master launches its fifth arm on the internet—a website powered by GitHub. Here, we will strive to update league tables for all the leagues we are covering. This website will go live for the Indian Football Season 2025-26, starting in July.</p>

    <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
    <p>Here’s to many more years of Indian Football. From grassroots to glory, Maidaan Master is here to represent the beautiful game. One league at a time.</p>
